# ICCUWN
ICCUWN (I Couldn't Come Up With a Name) is a minimalistic, simple and open source GUI for yt-dlp.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/s-liwka/ICCUWN/blob/main/images/screenshot1.png?raw=true)

## But Why?
All GUI's for yt-dlp i found were either broken or way too bloated for me. Also I wanted to get some experience with GUI's (and got some with asynchronous programming on the way too).

## Installation

1. Install Python (3.11.4 works for me) and ffmpeg

2. Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/s-liwka/ICCUWN
```
```
cd ICCUWN
```

Optional: Make a venv
```
python -m venv ICCUWN-venv
```
Linux:
```
ICCUWN-venv/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```
ICCUWN-venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

3. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run
```
python iccuwn.py
```
